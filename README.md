Student Management System
The Student Management System is a command-line based application developed using Python that allows users to manage student records efficiently. The system supports basic operations such as adding, viewing, searching, and deleting student information. Student data is stored persistently in a CSV file, making the application lightweight, portable, and easy to maintain. This project demonstrates the practical use of file handling, data structures, and modular programming concepts in Python .
